Why WhatsApp Automation with Selenium Cannot Run on iOS

1. No Browser Automation Support:
   - iOS does not allow running Selenium WebDriver or ChromeDriver.
   - Selenium requires desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox) with WebDriver support, which iOS browsers do not have.
   - Mobile Safari and other iOS browsers don’t expose automation hooks needed for Selenium.

2. No Access to Desktop WhatsApp Web on iOS:
   - WhatsApp Web is designed for desktop browsers.
   - Mobile browsers either redirect to WhatsApp app or limit WhatsApp Web functionality.
   - WhatsApp Web on iOS is not fully functional and does not support automation.

3. No Execution of Background Scripts:
   - iOS apps run in sandboxed environments with strict security.
   - Running scripts that control other apps (like WhatsApp) or automate UI clicks is not allowed.
   - Apps cannot launch and control other apps’ UI automatically.

4. No Support for ChromeDriver or Similar:
   - ChromeDriver and other browser drivers are desktop executables.
   - iOS cannot run these executables due to its OS architecture and app restrictions.

Why Desktop WhatsApp App Cannot Auto-Type Messages

1. WhatsApp Desktop App Security:
   - WhatsApp desktop app does not provide an API for sending messages programmatically.
   - It is designed to prevent automated message sending to avoid spam and misuse.

2. Lack of Automation Hooks:
   - Unlike WhatsApp Web, desktop app does not expose web elements that can be controlled via Selenium.
   - Automation tools must use complex UI automation frameworks (e.g., AutoHotkey, AppleScript) that depend on OS.

3. Manual User Interaction Required:
   - To send messages, user must manually interact with the UI.
   - This prevents bots from sending messages automatically.

Summary:
- iOS cannot run Selenium or ChromeDriver, making your current automation code incompatible.
- WhatsApp Web automation requires desktop browsers.
- WhatsApp Desktop app lacks APIs and automation hooks for programmatically sending messages.
- On iOS, the best you can do is open WhatsApp app with a pre-filled message and let the user manually send it.
